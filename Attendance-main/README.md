# QR-Based Student Attendance System (React, Spring Boot, MySQL)

* Engineered a secure, full-stack attendance system to precisely verify student GPS location (Geofencing) before enabling QR code check-in.
* The primary use is to eliminate proxy attendance by ensuring students are physically within the designated classroom perimeter for authenticated logging.
